💬 I'm a Cytotechnologist with over 5 years of experience in cytology, anatomical pathology, education, and digital pathology. My passion for continuous learning has led me to pursue new skills in Python, SQL, and Machine Learning for data analysis at Ironhack's bootcamp.

I have...

* 🌎 Participated in regional, national, and international conference presentations.
* 🔍 12+ publications, including [AI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41379-022-01147-y) and digital pathology research.
