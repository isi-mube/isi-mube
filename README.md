I am a **Data Scientist** and **Educator** with over 5 years of experience in **Cytology** (as cytotechnologist), **Education** (as professor and advocate) & **Digital Pathology** (as Specialist). Currently working as **Data Science Lead Teacher**, mentoring future data professionals in [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/us).

My commitment to lifelong learning led me to acquire new skills in **Python**, **Machine learning**, and **Deep Learning**, focusing on **Computer Vision** to make a positive impact on **Healthcare**.

One of my recent projects, [cytology-codex](https://github.com/isi-mube/cytology-codex) gained recognition and was showcased in **Ironhack Hackshows** (2023, September) & during the **European Congress of Cytology** in Budapest (2023, October), where it also got **published** in [Cytopathology Journal](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/13652303/2023/34/S1).

Also;

- Published 11+ research articles, including [AI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41379-022-01147-y) and guidelines for [Digital Pathology](https://books.google.es/books/about/Gu%C3%ADa_de_Calidad_en_Citopatolog%C3%ADa.html?id=CBzsDwAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y) implementation.
- Presented at regional, national, and international conferences.
- Secretary of the [European Advisory Committee of Cytotechnology](https://www.efcs.eu/links/eacc-advisory-commitee/). Past board member of the [Spanish Society of Cytology](https://secitologia.org/).
- Psychology student, 1-year coursed.
- In love with [calisthenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calisthenics), movement, fruit & books.
